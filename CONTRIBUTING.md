======

This is the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of our project. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!


## Team members

* GitHub Issues: [https://github.com/theshka/visitorTracking/issues](https://github.com/theshka/visitorTracking/issues)


## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes.

visitorTracking uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
* This is how we like people to add new features:
    - Fork the repository
    - Create a feature branch
        -Prefix with feature/, bugfix/, etc..
    - Make and save your changes
    - Update documentation, version numbers, etc..
    - Create a pull-request


* Here are some specifics on the coding style we prefer:

    - [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
    - [PSR-1 Code-Styling](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)


* Make sure to update the changelog! :)

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around: 3-5 days.
